# addTwoNumbers Function Explanation

The `addTwoNumbers` function in a solution class is a solution to the problem of adding two numbers represented by linked lists. It efficiently handles the addition of digits, considering the order of storage in reverse. Let's break down its functionality, implementation, and analyze its time and space complexity.

## How it Works:

### Initialization:
- **`dummyHead`:** A dummy head (`dummyHead`) is created, acting as the starting point of the result linked list. It simplifies the code by avoiding special cases for the head.
- **`current`:** A `current` pointer is initialized to traverse the result linked list.
- **`carry`:** An integer variable (`carry`) is used to store the carry value during addition.

### Traverse Linked Lists:
- The algorithm iterates through both input linked lists (`l1` and `l2`) simultaneously, adding corresponding digits along with the carry from the previous step.

### Update Result Linked List:
- For each pair of digits, the algorithm calculates the sum (`sum`) and updates the result linked list with the units digit of the sum. The carry for the next iteration is also updated.

### Continue Iteration:
- The process continues until both input lists are fully traversed, and there is no carry left.

### Resulting Linked List:
- The resulting linked list starts right after the `dummyHead`.

## Implementation:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* addTwoNumbers(ListNode* l1, ListNode* l2) {
        ListNode* dummyHead = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode* current = dummyHead;
        int carry = 0;

        while (l1 || l2 || carry) {
            int sum = (l1 ? l1->val : 0) + (l2 ? l2->val : 0) + carry;
            carry = sum / 10;

            current->next = new ListNode(sum % 10);
            current = current->next;

            if (l1) l1 = l1->next;
            if (l2) l2 = l2->next;
        }

        return dummyHead->next;
    }
};
```
# Complexity Analysis:

**Time Complexity:** O(max(N, M)), where N and M are the lengths of the input linked lists. The algorithm traverses both lists simultaneously.

**Space Complexity:** O(max(N, M)). The space is primarily used for the result linked list. The additional space is used for variables (dummyHead, current, carry). The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space per node.
